<h1>Orange Glory</h1> 
A dark, orange-themed CSS theme for BetterDiscord. Uses some of the CRT code from <a href="https://b4t3s.github.io/Fallout4TerminalTheme">Bate's Fallout 4 Terminal theme</a>. This is a very basic theme made for my own enjoyment really, so feel free to mess with the code if desired! It definitely doesn't make everything orange, but it sure tries. Also some fun transitions included!
